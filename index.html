        <h2><em3>About Lucifer</em3></h2>
        <p>Lucifer is a <em>Netflix Original</em> TV series that started out in 2016 and now has 6 seasons.
        <br>The show has a 8.1 star review on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4052886/">www.imdb.com</a> and is enjoyed by millions around the world.
        <br>The plot of the show is that Lucifer the devil has decided to visit earth in human form because he got bored of hell.
        <br>However on his vacation to earth he finds his first true love, which ironically is a detective for the LAPD.</p>
        
        <h2>What I Enjoy About The Show</h2>
        <p>I watched Lucifer a total of 6 times through and still haven't got bored of it.
        <br>You could call it obsessive but I really enjoy many aspects of this Tv series.
        <br>I like to see Lucifer and Chloe's relationship develop as she finds out the truth.
        <br>I also like how theologically based the show is with very little fiction in it.
        <br>I really enjoy the detective work and figuring out murders with the devil himself.
        <br>I studied Christian theology so I am interested in seeing a Jewish perspective.</p>
